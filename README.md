# Grem

Grem Is A Decentralised Social Media App Based On IPFS and The Ethereum Blockchain.

We are using IPFS and Ethereum to make a social media app which will change the industry forever, giving users a literal 100% control over their data, as the user directly communicates with the IPFS network and the Ethereum Blockchain.

**Note - we are using firebase as of now, just to get a picture of how things work and so that we can understand the working and make our app as efficent as possible.**
